## Week #4 - Netflix Movie Tracker

Start Date: 2020.04.01

## Challenge Description
This week's challenge was to create an object prototype to store information about specific movies. Additionally, we needed to have a method within the function show a blurb about the movie with the object's properties filling in the blanks when that method was called. 
 

## Explain your solution

I first created an object prototype using an object constructor to set up the parameters for the properties I wanted to store for each movie. I created a method for the movie object prototype to alert the user with a message that conveyed the object properties in narrative form. I then created new instances of movie objects, one for each movie I chose from the Netflix Roulette website, that contained the specific arguments to match the parameters from the prototype. I did this by calling the constructor function with the "new" keyword. On my HTML page, I called each object's method through an onclick function of a button, and I made a button for each movie. 

## What are you thoughts about this challenge? Did you like it?

I enjoyed this project very much because I had all the knowledge I needed to complete the task without having to look up anything. I did end up researching adding properties to an object that was created with Object Constructor Notation when adding the last parameter of watched or unwatched based on the directions. Overall, it felt good to read the challenge and know exactly what I wanted to do to make it happen.


## What have you learned from it?
I got more practice with creating object protoypes using an object constructor function and creating objects of that type by calling the constructor function with the "new" keyword. I learned that you cannot add a new property to an object constructor in the same way you would add a new property to an already-existing object created with Object Literal Notation.

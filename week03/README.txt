Remove the BugBear!
There is a BugBear in your home and it is ruining your life!

You would like to destroy it completely, but due to some life changes you became vegan and no longer have the desire to kill any living creature.
So, you will just release it into the wild where it can be removed from this planet naturally by some other predator.

The Goal
You want to find and fix all the "bugs" in this project so an image of a BugBear will be shown inside the house (behind a closed door).
You should be able to click the door and release the BugBear into the wild.
You should also be able to click the door again to close it (trapping the BugBear again inside your home).

The Criteria... or CREATURE-ia...
1.	Make sure all tags and variables are consistent.
2.	Have any relevant files connected properly.
3.	Fix any grammatical errors
4.	Ensure the images show on the browser
5.	Fix the code to make sure the image can change when you click door
6.	You are welcome to change the CSS to change/add more styling
7.	You are welcome to change code to make it cleaner and dryer.
8.	Use git and GitHub to save different versions when you make mistakes OR delete something you would regret.

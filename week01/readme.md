## Challenge Description

The challenge this week was to write a script that asks a user for a username using prompt. 

The user enters a username. If the username is "admin", the user will be prompted for a password. If the username is left empty, the user will be given an alert that says "Canceled". If the user enters anything other than "admin", the user will be given an alert that says "I don't know you."

If the user entered "admin" as their username, they will be prompted for a password. If they input the password "TheMaster", they will be shown an alert that says "Welcome!". If they leave the password prompt black, they will be given an alert that says "Canceled". If they enter anything other than "TheMaster" as the password, they will be shown an alert that says "Wrong password". 

## Explain your solution

Explain how you came up with the solution. What did you use to solve the problem?

I used a function with "if, else... if, else" statements, and then nested another set of "if, else... if, else" statements within the first "if" statement. The first set of statements for the function parse out what happens when the user inputs (or fails to input) a username. The nested "if, else... if, else" statements give the program directions if the user inputed the correct username on the initial prompt to test whether the password entered is correct. In the html file, I used a single button to trigger the function to check the username and password as described above. 

## What are you thoughts about this challenge? Did you like it?

I enjoyed this challenge a lot. It gave me the opportunity to solidify and expand my skills with JavaScript functions. I only experienced a little frustration at one point in getting my code to do what I wanted it to, but I walked away for a few minutes and was able to identify the issue when I came back to my computer. 

## What have you learned from it?

This challenge helped me better understand functions and I taught myself how to nest if statements within other if statements. I also became more confident with calling functions when a button is clicked.
